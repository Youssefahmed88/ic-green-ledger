# üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

This document provides a professional, modular, and extensible **System Design Specification** for a decentralized crop insurance platform built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. The system targets small-scale farmers in regions like **Malawi**, offering seasonal insurance against climate-related events like droughts or heavy rainfall.

The system architecture separates concerns across several **Rust-based canisters** and **native ICP services** for scalability, auditability, and complete decentralization.

## üß± Canister Architecture

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Main Canister ‚Äì `policy_manager`
Manages the lifecycle of crop insurance policies using Rust and IC-CDK:

#### Core Responsibilities:
- Create new policies (full-season or sub-season)
- Manage farmer subscriptions and registrations
- Enforce subscription constraints and timing
- Coordinate with Treasury & Payout canisters
- Handle Internet Identity authentication

#### Key Features:
- Only one **full-season** policy per farmer per season
- Sub-seasonal policies can be purchased if full-season wasn't
- Subscription has deadlines aligned with Malawi crop calendar
- Integrates with Treasury canister for fund management
- Tracks policy status (Active, Paused, PayoutTriggered) in stable memory
- Cross-canister calls to trigger payouts
- Policy data persists across canister upgrades

#### Data Structures:
- Policy records with farmer identification
- Policy types and seasonal coverage
- Premium and coverage amounts
- Status tracking through policy lifecycle

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Treasury Canister ‚Äì `treasury_manager`
Handles all funds securely using ICP's native token standards.

#### Core Responsibilities:
- Receive premium payments in ICP tokens or ckUSDC
- Secure fund storage in canister cycles and tokens
- Release funds to `payout_engine` on valid payout requests
- Implement multi-signature controls for large payouts
- Track all financial transactions in stable memory

#### ICP Token Integration:
- **ICP Tokens**: Native protocol tokens for premium payments
- **ckUSDC**: Chain-key USD Coin for stable value payouts
- **ICRC-1/ICRC-2**: Standard token interfaces for transfers
- **Cycles**: For canister computational costs

#### Security Features:
- Principal-based access control
- Time-locked withdrawals for large amounts
- Audit trail of all transactions
- Automatic backup to stable memory

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Payout Engine Canister ‚Äì `payout_engine`
Coordinates payout distribution based on policy triggers.

#### Core Responsibilities:
- Receives trigger requests from `weather_oracle`
- Validates payout conditions against policy terms
- Executes cross-canister calls to Treasury for fund release
- Notifies `policy_manager` to mark policies as triggered
- Maintains payout history and analytics

#### Payout Processing:
- Receives and validates trigger requests from weather oracle
- Calculates payout amounts based on policy terms and trigger severity
- Executes cross-canister calls to Treasury for secure fund release
- Updates policy status and maintains comprehensive payout history

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Weather Oracle Canister ‚Äì `weather_oracle`
Fetches and validates weather data using ICP's native HTTPS outcalls.

#### Core Responsibilities:
- Makes direct **HTTPS outcalls** to weather APIs (no external oracles needed)
- Processes rainfall and temperature data for Malawi regions
- Implements **periodic monitoring** using ICP timers
- Validates data integrity across multiple sources
- Triggers payout logic when drought conditions are met

#### Weather Data Sources:
- Malawi Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services
- OpenWeatherMap API
- NASA's POWER API
- Local weather station networks

#### Weather Monitoring Process:
- **Direct API Integration**: Makes HTTPS outcalls to multiple weather services without intermediaries
- **Data Processing**: Analyzes rainfall patterns, temperature data, and drought indicators specific to Malawi's climate
- **Automated Scheduling**: Uses ICP's native timer system for continuous monitoring during crop seasons
- **Multi-Source Validation**: Cross-references data from multiple APIs to ensure accuracy and prevent manipulation
- **Trigger Logic**: Evaluates drought conditions against policy parameters and initiates payout process when thresholds are met

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ NFT Canister ‚Äì `policy_nft`
Mints unique NFTs to represent farmer policy subscriptions using ICRC-7 standard.

#### Core Responsibilities:
- Mint NFTs on successful policy subscription
- Store rich metadata about policies and farmers
- Enable policy transfer and secondary markets (if permitted)
- Provide visual proof of insurance coverage

#### NFT Metadata Components:
- **Farmer Identity**: Principal-based identification linked to Internet Identity
- **Policy Details**: Coverage type, season, amounts, and terms
- **Farm Information**: Geographic coordinates and crop details
- **Visual Elements**: Custom artwork representing policy status and coverage level
- **Timestamps**: Issue date and policy period for verification

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Asset Storage Canister ‚Äì `asset_storage`
Manages static assets and rich media content.

#### Core Responsibilities:
- Store policy documents and images
- Serve NFT artwork and metadata
- Handle multilingual content (English/Chichewa)
- Provide CDN-like asset delivery

## üîÅ System Workflow

```plaintext
Farmer connects via Internet Identity
      ‚Üì
PolicyManager displays available policies for current season
      ‚Üì
Farmer subscribes to policy (PolicyManager ‚Üí Treasury)
      ‚Üì
NFT minted with policy details (PolicyNFT)
      ‚Üì
WeatherOracle monitors conditions (Native HTTPS + Timers)
      ‚Üì
Drought Detected ‚Üí PayoutEngine validates conditions
      ‚Üì
Treasury releases ICP/ckUSDC to farmer's wallet
      ‚Üì
Policy marked as PayoutTriggered
      ‚Üì
Farmer receives instant notification
```

## üîí Security Measures

### Canister-Level Security:
- **Principal-based access control**: Only authorized canisters can make cross-canister calls
- **Stable memory persistence**: Critical data survives canister upgrades
- **Input validation**: All external inputs validated before processing
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent spam and DoS attacks
- **Timer-based automation**: Removes human intervention points

### Financial Security:
- **Multi-signature payouts**: Large payments require multiple approvals
- **Time-locked withdrawals**: Prevent rapid fund drainage
- **Audit trails**: Complete transaction history in stable memory
- **Token standard compliance**: Use proven ICRC standards

### Data Integrity:
- **Multiple weather sources**: Cross-validate data from different APIs
- **Cryptographic verification**: Hash-based data integrity checks
- **Deterministic execution**: Consistent results across replica nodes
