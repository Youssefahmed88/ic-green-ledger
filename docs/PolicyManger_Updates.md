## üß© Advanced Features in `v1`

### üßø Seasonal Policy Management

- Includes: `season`, `seasonStart`, `seasonEnd`, and `subscriptionDeadline`
- Supports resubscription across seasons

### üîÑ Full vs Partial Coverage Logic

- `coversFullSeason` boolean to control exclusivity
- Mapping to prevent sub-policy if full-season is already selected

### üèõ Integration with External Treasury

- Uses:

```solidity
interface ITreasury {
    function deposit(address farmer) external payable;
}
```

- Sends premiums to a treasury instead of holding contract balance

### ¬†Controlled Payout Flow

- `payoutEngine` contract must explicitly call `markPolicyAsPayout()`
- Ensures external conditions (e.g. oracle feeds) can trigger payout securely

---

## üîΩ Simplified Features in `v2`

- Fixed payout based on `address(this).balance`
- No external calls, oracles, or seasonal dynamics
- Meant for educational/demonstration use
